# Teaching Python Programming for Bioinformatics with Jupyter Notebook in the Post-COVID-19 Era 

Welcome to the Jupyter Notebook interface! Here, you will be able to learn basic Python scripting and genomics using our user-friendly platform. With the shift to remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we understand the need for an alternative approach to traditional teaching methods. Our modified Bioinformatics course utilizes Jupyter Notebook to allow students to acquire the necessary skills for basic DNA sequence analysis while working remotely.

Jupyter Notebook offers a versatile and interactive approach to learning. It allows us to combine explanations, code, and results in a single document, providing students with the opportunity to interact with the code and results. This feature makes the learning process more engaging and effective, as students are able to see how the code works in real-time.

Our approach using Jupyter Notebook provides a hybrid approach to learning that is effective for remote teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. By using Jupyter Notebook, we have been able to successfully modify our Bioinformatics course and provide students with the necessary skills for DNA sequence analysis.

We hope that you find the Jupyter Notebook interface easy to use and that it enhances your learning experience. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
